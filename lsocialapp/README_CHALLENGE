To install: (I used Ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3.1.1)

`cd lsocialapp`

`bundle install`

`rake db:setup`

Start the server with `rails s` and you can upload and view purchases from the main page.

Here is my submitted entry for the LivingSocial Associate Developer position. I haven't done much rails development in the past, but I wanted to try and get a grasp of it for this challenge and for the future. My application has 4 models: purchases, merchants, customers, and imports. The first three are self-explanatory. The forth model is the class that handles file imports (using the paperclip gem). 

The importer model handles the CSV parsing, using Rail's default csv library. I'd rather have that code in a separate controller, but found it just a bit tricky in terms of how to reference the file itself from a controller instead of from the model.

I used scaffolds to generate the models, which I know in the rails world generally isn't the best practice, but it's a lifesaver in terms of just figuring out default syntax and whatnot for the first time.

Any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks!
